            3997: Research Methods Independent Study</h3>
            <p>Spring 2026</p>
            <p>Instructor: Lee Tusman<br />
            Office Hours: By appointment - Mondays and Wednesdays</p>
            <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
            <p>This independent study introduces research methods used
            in media studies, cultural studies, and the arts. Rather
            than learning methods in the abstract, we’ll learn by
            doing—trying different approaches to see what fits your
            thinking. You’ll explore methods like ethnography, close
            reading, critical fabulation, autoethnography, and digital
            analysis through hands-on exercises and collaborative
            work.</p>
            <p>The goal isn’t to become an expert in all methods, but to
            discover which approaches help you think more clearly about
            what you’re curious about. By semester’s end, you’ll have
            experimented with multiple research approaches, developed a
            project based on your interests, and reflected critically on
            your own learning process.</p>

            <p>I’m here to think alongside you. Your interests drive the
            study. Work happens during our meetings and between, when
            you dive deep into your areas of interest, exploring from
            the inside out. Try things, engage generously, and let’s
            make this good.</p>
            <p>The goals of our research methodolgy are meant to
            emphasize process over polish, curiosity over argument, and
            methodological awareness throughout.</p>
            <h3 id="note-on-this-syllabus">Note on this syllabus</h3>
            <p>This syllabus may change and adapt based on areas that
            come up in discussion, from input from students, or adapting
            to current news media and other input. When this happens,
            the change will be brought up in our meeting, and updated on
            the course website and Brightspace.</p>
            <h2 id="course-outline">Course Outline</h2>
            <p><strong>Weeks 1-2: Foundations &amp;
            Exploration</strong>: Begin by mapping your current
            interests and questions. What draws you to media, arts, or
            society? Keep a research journal to track emerging
            curiosities. Read introductory texts on various research
            methods to get a lay of the land. Identify methods that
            initially resonate with you.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 3-4: Close Reading &amp; Textual
            Analysis</strong>: Practice close reading with media
            texts—film scenes, advertisements, social media posts, or
            artworks. Pay attention to details you’d normally overlook.
            Try different analytical frameworks (semiotics, narrative
            analysis, visual rhetoric) and see which reveals something
            interesting about your chosen text. Write short analytical
            exercises rather than formal papers.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 5-6: Ethnography &amp;
            Observation</strong>: Observe a media practice or cultural
            space—a gaming community, Instagram subculture, gallery
            opening, or streaming chat. Take detailed field notes. What
            do people actually do versus what they say they do?
            Experiment with thick description. Consider what this method
            shows you that close reading couldn’t.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 7-8: Autoethnography &amp; Critical
            Fabulation</strong>: Turn the lens on yourself. Examine your
            own media consumption, creative practice, or cultural
            participation. How does your experience illuminate broader
            patterns? Try critical fabulation—imagining alternative
            narratives or speculative scenarios based on gaps in
            existing research. Get comfortable with creative-critical
            hybrid approaches.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 9-10: Digital Methods &amp; Data</strong>:
            Explore digital research tools suited to your
            interests—basic social media analysis, digital archives,
            computational text analysis, or network mapping. The goal
            isn’t technical mastery but understanding what digital
            methods can and can’t tell you. Compare findings with your
            earlier ethnographic or textual work.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 11-12: Project Development</strong>: Choose
            one method (or a combination) that best suits your research
            question. Design a small-scale project you can actually
            complete. Develop your research question, methodology, and
            plan for execution. Share your proposal with your advisor
            for feedback.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 13-14: Project Execution &amp;
            Analysis</strong>: Conduct your research. Collect data, make
            observations, or perform your analysis. Stay
            flexible—research rarely goes exactly as planned, and
            adapting your approach is part of the learning.</p>
            <p><strong>Week 15: Reflection &amp; Presentation</strong>:
            Complete your project and, importantly, reflect on your
            research process. What did this method reveal? What did it
            obscure? How did your question evolve? What would you do
            differently? Prepare a presentation of both your findings
            and your methodological insights.</p>

            1: Observational Field Notes (2-3 pages)</h4>
            <p>As you watch <em>Preserving Worlds</em>, take detailed
            notes as if you’re an ethnographer studying both the virtual
            worlds AND the people who built them. What do you notice
            about how people talk about their creations? What seems
            important to them vs. what the filmmakers emphasize? Pay
            attention to moments of loss, preservation, memory. What’s
            visible in these worlds and what’s absent? Don’t analyze
            yet—just observe and record with as much detail as
            possible.</p>

            <p>The filmmakers made choices about how to tell this story.
            What research methods are they using? Are they doing
            ethnography (interviewing, observing)? Archival work
            (collecting screenshots, code)? Close reading of the worlds
            themselves? Something else? Write about what you can see of
            their methodology. What do these choices reveal and what
            might they obscure?</p>
            <p>How do the filmmakers’ methods compare to how Turkle or
            Rheingold approached studying online communities in the 90s?
            What’s similar or different about their ways of knowing and

            artifact from your own past. This could be from the 90s,
            2000s, or last year—whenever something felt significant to
            you. What made it matter? Does it still exist? How would you
            research it now? What’s been preserved and what’s lost? Let
            yourself be curious and unsure.</p>

            <p>Choose a specific digital artifact to analyze closely.
            This could be: - A level or scene from a game - A particular
            social media interface (TikTok’s FYP, Instagram Stories,
            Discord server) - A virtual world space (even just from
            screenshots) - A website captured in the Wayback Machine - A
            meme format or viral moment</p>
            <p>Describe it in extreme detail first—interface elements,
            visual design, interactive possibilities, temporal
            structures. Then analyze: What assumptions about
            users/players are built into the design? What behaviors does
            it encourage or discourage? What narratives or ideologies
            are embedded in its formal structures? What would someone
            from 1995 or 2045 make of this?</p>
            <p>Don’t aim for a thesis-driven argument. Instead, use
            close reading as a method of discovery—what becomes visible
            when you slow down and pay attention?</p>

            Prompt: Mini-Ethnography (4-5 pages)</h3>
            <p>Spend 5-7 days observing (and possibly participating in)
            an online community or digital space. Options:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>A gaming community (Discord, subreddit, in-game
            guild)</li>
            <li>A creative community (fan fiction, TikTok subculture,
            art Instagram)</li>
            <li>A professional/interest group (YouTube comments, Twitch
            chat, forum)</li>
            <li>A virtual world or social platform</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keep detailed field notes: What do people do? What do
            they talk about? What rules (stated and unstated) govern
            behavior? What conflicts arise? What gets celebrated? Take
            screenshots if appropriate and ethical. Pay attention to
            rituals, inside jokes, hierarchies, and how newbies are
            treated.</p>
            <p>Then write up your observations using “thick
            description”—not just what happened, but what it might mean
            in context. What surprised you? What didn’t you understand?
            Be honest about the limitations of your access and
            perspective. What would you need to observe longer to
            understand?</p>
            <p><strong>Ethics note:</strong> Include a paragraph
            reflecting on the ethics of your observation. Did you
            disclose you were researching? Why or why not? What felt
            appropriate or uncomfortable?</p>
            <p><strong>Methodological reflection:</strong> How does your
            approach compare to what you’ve read in Taylor, Nardi,
            Boellstorff, or Geertz? What ethnographic techniques did you
            borrow or adapt? What was different about your situation or
            access? If you were to extend this research, what would you
            do differently based on what these scholars modeled?</p>

            <h3 id="overview-3">Overview</h3>
            <p>Turn the lens on yourself. Examine your own media
            consumption, creative practice, or cultural participation.
            How does your experience illuminate broader patterns? Try
            critical fabulation—imagining alternative narratives or
            speculative scenarios based on gaps in existing research.
            Get comfortable with creative-critical hybrid
            approaches.</p>

            Critical Fabulation (3-4 pages)</h4>
            <p>Following Saidiya Hartman’s method, write about a
            disappeared or barely-documented digital space, community,
            or moment. This could be:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>An early online community that left few traces</li>
            <li>A game server that shut down</li>
            <li>Your own lost digital artifacts (emails, MySpace page,
            forum posts)</li>
            <li>A platform or feature that no longer exists</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use the fragments you can find (screenshots, Wayback
            Machine captures, others’ memories) as evidence, but allow
            yourself to imagine and speculate. What might have happened
            in the gaps? Who might have been there whose stories weren’t
            recorded? Write in a way that acknowledges you’re imagining
            while staying grounded in what little evidence exists.
            Reflect on what this method allows you to say that straight
            archival work wouldn’t.</p>
            <h4 id="option-b-autoethnography-3-4-pages">Option B:
            Autoethnography (3-4 pages)</h4>
            <p>Write about your own relationship to a digital platform,
            practice, or community. Make your personal experience the
            subject of analysis. How does your specific experience
            illuminate broader patterns about digital culture, media
            consumption, identity, or community?</p>
            <p>Use “I” freely, but also step back: What cultural forces
            shaped your experience? What assumptions did you bring? How
            has your relationship to this space/practice changed over
            time? Connect your story to broader questions about media,
            memory, identity, or community.</p>
            <p>This isn’t memoir—it’s using your experience as data to
            understand something larger.</p>

            isn’t technical mastery but understanding what digital

            <ul>
            <li>Use Wayback Machine to trace how a website evolved over
            time</li>

            themselves shape what you found? Even if you’re working on a

            <p><strong>1. Research Question/Curiosity:</strong> What are
            you investigating? Frame this as genuine curiosity, not a
            predetermined argument. What do you want to understand
            better?</p>
            <p><strong>2. Methodology:</strong> Which research method(s)
            will you use? Why are these appropriate for your question?
            Will you do interviews (ethnography)? Analyze texts or
            platforms (close reading)? Work with archives or memory? Use
            your own experience (autoethnography)? Combine
            approaches?</p>
            <p><strong>3. Media Form:</strong> Why documentary, podcast,
            video essay, or audio piece? What can this form do that a
            written essay can’t? What aesthetic or structural choices
            will you make?</p>
            <p><strong>4. Failed Experiments:</strong> What have you
            tried that didn’t work? What dead ends taught you something?
            This is crucial—research is messy.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Prototype Description:</strong> Describe your
            2-3 minute sample. What will it show about your
            approach?</p>
            <p><strong>6. Timeline &amp; Next Steps:</strong> What do
            you need to do in the next few weeks?</p>
            <p>Be specific but stay flexible. The point is to articulate
            your thinking so far, not lock yourself into something that

            <p>This accompanies your creative project. Reflect on:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Evolution:</strong> How did your question,
            approach, and project change from proposal to completion?
            What caused those changes?</p>
            <p><strong>2. Method in Practice:</strong> How did your
            chosen research method shape what you discovered? What did
            it let you see? What did it obscure or leave out? Would a
            different method have produced different insights?</p>
            <p><strong>3. Form &amp; Content:</strong> How did the
            creative/documentary form shape your research? What could
            you express through audio/video/multimedia that you couldn’t
            in writing? What challenges did the form present?</p>
            <p><strong>4. Failures &amp; Surprises:</strong> What didn’t
            work? What surprised you? What would you do differently if
            you started over?</p>
            <p><strong>5. Epistemological Reflection:</strong> What does
            this process teach you about how we know things? About the
            relationship between method and knowledge? About your own
            way of thinking and investigating?</p>
            <p>Avoid generic reflection (“I learned a lot”). Be specific
            about methodological insights. Quote from your own field
            notes, failed drafts, or earlier exercises. Show your
            thinking process.</p>

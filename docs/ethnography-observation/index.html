      <h1>Ethnography and Observation</h1>
            <p><em>Date: 2026-02-22</em></p>
            <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
            <p>Observe a media practice or cultural space—a gaming
            community, Instagram subculture, or streaming chat, among
            other examples. Take detailed field notes. What do people
            actually do versus what they say they do? Experiment with
            thick description. Consider what this method shows you that
            close reading couldn’t.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>“A virtual ethnography is one that fully immerses the
            ethnographer into the consensual reality experienced by
            groups of people who use computer-mediated communication as
            their primary, and often only, means of communication. As
            such, the online or virtual personas of the participants are
            the main focus of the ethnographer. Generally, researchers
            have wanted to focus on the person at the keyboard; a
            virtual ethnography reverses this and works instead with the
            persona that has been projected into cyberspace by the
            typist.” –1999 Issues in virtual ethnography. In K. Buckner
            (Ed.), Proceedings of Esprit i3 workshop on ethnographic
            studies(pp. 61-69). Edinburgh: Queen Margaret College.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>The ‘mLab server’ is one of the most modded Minecraft
            servers in the world. But what makes it really special is
            that it is owned by academic game research centres of
            Concordia University where the players—students and
            professors—all work together in real life. Their real life
            friendships, objectives and conflicts result in fascinating,
            self-reflexive and sometimes explosive gameplay.</p>

            Prompt: Mini-Ethnography (4-5 pages)</h3>
            <p>Spend 5-7 days observing (and possibly participating in)
            an online community or digital space. Options:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>A gaming community (Discord, subreddit, in-game
            guild)</li>
            <li>A creative community (fan fiction, TikTok subculture,
            art Instagram)</li>
            <li>A professional/interest group (YouTube comments, Twitch
            chat, forum)</li>
            <li>A virtual world or social platform</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What do people do? What topics are talked about? What
            rules (stated and unstated) govern behavior? What conflicts
            arise? What gets celebrated? Pay attention to rituals,
            inside jokes, hierarchies, and how newbies are treated.</p>
            <p>Then write up your observations using “thick
            description”—not what happened, but what it might mean in
            context. What surprised you? What didn’t you understand? Be
            honest about the limitations of your access and perspective.
            What would you need to observe longer to understand?</p>
            <p><strong>Methodological reflection:</strong> How does your
            approach compare to what you’ve read in Taylor, Nardi,
            Boellstorff, or Geertz? What ethnographic techniques did you
            borrow or adapt? What was different about your situation or
            access? If you were to continue this research, what would
            you do differently based on what these scholars modeled?</p>

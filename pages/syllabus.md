## Course Description

This independent study introduces research methods used in media studies, cultural studies, and the arts. Rather than learning methods in the abstract, we'll learn by doing—trying different approaches to see what fits your thinking. You'll explore methods like ethnography, close reading, critical fabulation, autoethnography, and digital analysis through hands-on exercises and collaborative work.

The goal isn't to become an expert in all methods, but to discover which approaches help you think more clearly about what you're curious about. By semester's end, you'll have experimented with multiple research approaches, developed a project based on your interests, and reflected critically on your own learning process.

## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Identify and describe key research methodologies in media and cultural studies.
* Apply qualitative and creative-critical methods to specific objects of study.
* Design a research proposal that aligns a specific inquiry with an appropriate methodology.
* Critically reflect on the ethics and positionality of the researcher in the production of knowledge.
* Communicate research findings effectively through oral presentation and written reflection.

### How This Course Works: 

I’m here to think alongside you. Your interests drive the study. Work happens during our meetings and between, when you dive deep into your areas of interest, exploring from the inside out. Try things, engage generously, and let's make this good.

The goals of our research methodolgy are meant to emphasize process over polish, curiosity over argument, and methodological awareness throughout.

### Note on this syllabus

This syllabus may change and adapt based on areas that come up in discussion, from input from students, or adapting to current news media and other input. When this happens, the change will be brought up in our meeting, and updated on the course website and Brightspace.

## Course Outline

**Weeks 1-2: Foundations & Exploration**: Begin by mapping your current interests and questions. What draws you to media, arts, or society? Keep a research journal to track emerging curiosities. Read introductory texts on various research methods to get a lay of the land. Identify methods that initially resonate with you.

**Weeks 3-4: Close Reading & Textual Analysis**: Practice close reading with media texts—film scenes, advertisements, social media posts, or artworks. Pay attention to details you'd normally overlook. Try different analytical frameworks (semiotics, narrative analysis, visual rhetoric) and see which reveals something interesting about your chosen text. Write short analytical exercises rather than formal papers.

**Weeks 5-6: Ethnography & Observation**: Observe a media practice or cultural space—a gaming community, Instagram subculture, gallery opening, or streaming chat. Take detailed field notes. What do people actually do versus what they say they do? Experiment with thick description. Consider what this method shows you that close reading couldn't.

**Weeks 7-8: Autoethnography & Critical Fabulation**: Turn the lens on yourself. Examine your own media consumption, creative practice, or cultural participation. How does your experience illuminate broader patterns? Try critical fabulation—imagining alternative narratives or speculative scenarios based on gaps in existing research. Get comfortable with creative-critical hybrid approaches.

**Weeks 9-10: Digital Methods & Data**: Explore digital research tools suited to your interests—basic social media analysis, digital archives, computational text analysis, or network mapping. The goal isn't technical mastery but understanding what digital methods can and can't tell you. Compare findings with your earlier ethnographic or textual work.

**Weeks 11-12: Project Development**: Choose one method (or a combination) that best suits your research question. Design a small-scale project you can actually complete. Develop your research question, methodology, and plan for execution. Share your proposal with your advisor for feedback.

**Weeks 13-14: Project Execution & Analysis**: Conduct your research. Collect data, make observations, or perform your analysis. Stay flexible—research rarely goes exactly as planned, and adapting your approach is part of the learning.

**Week 15: Reflection & Presentation**: Complete your project and, importantly, reflect on your research process. What did this method reveal? What did it obscure? How did your question evolve? What would you do differently? Prepare a presentation of both your findings and your methodological insights.

### Writing Prompts

#### Prompt 1: Observational Field Notes (2-3 pages)

As you watch *Preserving Worlds*, take detailed notes as if you're an ethnographer studying both the virtual worlds AND the people who built them. What do you notice about how people talk about their creations? What seems important to them vs. what the filmmakers emphasize? Pay attention to moments of loss, preservation, memory. What's visible in these worlds and what's absent? Don't analyze yet—just observe and record with as much detail as possible.

#### Prompt 2: Methods Archaeology (1-2 pages)

The filmmakers made choices about how to tell this story. What research methods are they using? Are they doing ethnography (interviewing, observing)? Archival work (collecting screenshots, code)? Close reading of the worlds themselves? Something else? Write about what you can see of their methodology. What do these choices reveal and what might they obscure?

How do the filmmakers' methods compare to how Turkle or Rheingold approached studying online communities in the 90s? What's similar or different about their ways of knowing and documenting digital worlds?

#### Prompt 3: Your Digital Memory (1-2 pages)

Write about an online space, game, community, or digital artifact from your own past. This could be from the 90s, 2000s, or last year—whenever something felt significant to you. What made it matter? Does it still exist? How would you research it now? What's been preserved and what's lost? Let yourself be curious and unsure.

## Weeks 3-4: Close Reading & Digital Texts

### Overview
Practice close reading with media texts—film scenes, advertisements, social media posts, or artworks. Pay attention to details you'd normally overlook. Try different analytical frameworks (semiotics, narrative analysis, visual rhetoric) and see which reveals something interesting about your chosen text.

### Readings
- Janet Murray, selections from *Hamlet on the Holodeck* (1997) - narrative in digital environments
- Ian Bogost, "The Rhetoric of Video Games" - procedural rhetoric
- Lev Manovich, selections from *The Language of New Media* (2001)
- Practice readings: Choose a digital artifact (a game, virtual world screenshots, social media thread) for close analysis

### Writing Prompt: Formal Analysis Exercise (3-4 pages)

Choose a specific digital artifact to analyze closely. This could be:
- A level or scene from a game
- A particular social media interface (TikTok's FYP, Instagram Stories, Discord server)
- A virtual world space (even just from screenshots)
- A website captured in the Wayback Machine
- A meme format or viral moment

Describe it in extreme detail first—interface elements, visual design, interactive possibilities, temporal structures. Then analyze: What assumptions about users/players are built into the design? What behaviors does it encourage or discourage? What narratives or ideologies are embedded in its formal structures? What would someone from 1995 or 2045 make of this?

Don't aim for a thesis-driven argument. Instead, use close reading as a method of discovery—what becomes visible when you slow down and pay attention?

---

## Weeks 5-6: Ethnography & Observation

### Overview
Observe a media practice or cultural space—a gaming community, Instagram subculture, gallery opening, or streaming chat. Take detailed field notes. What do people actually do versus what they say they do? Experiment with thick description. Consider what this method shows you that close reading couldn't.

### Readings

- T.L. Taylor, excerpts from *Play Between Worlds* (2006) - ethnography of EverQuest
- Bonnie Nardi, *My Life as a Night Elf Priest* (2010) - selections on WoW ethnography
- Tom Boellstorff, excerpts from *Coming of Age in Second Life* (2008)
- Clifford Geertz, "Thick Description" - foundational ethnographic method

### Writing Prompt: Mini-Ethnography (4-5 pages)

Spend 5-7 days observing (and possibly participating in) an online community or digital space. Options:

- A gaming community (Discord, subreddit, in-game guild)
- A creative community (fan fiction, TikTok subculture, art Instagram)
- A professional/interest group (YouTube comments, Twitch chat, forum)
- A virtual world or social platform

Keep detailed field notes: What do people do? What do they talk about? What rules (stated and unstated) govern behavior? What conflicts arise? What gets celebrated? Take screenshots if appropriate and ethical. Pay attention to rituals, inside jokes, hierarchies, and how newbies are treated.

Then write up your observations using "thick description"—not just what happened, but what it might mean in context. What surprised you? What didn't you understand? Be honest about the limitations of your access and perspective. What would you need to observe longer to understand?

**Ethics note:** Include a paragraph reflecting on the ethics of your observation. Did you disclose you were researching? Why or why not? What felt appropriate or uncomfortable?

**Methodological reflection:** How does your approach compare to what you've read in Taylor, Nardi, Boellstorff, or Geertz? What ethnographic techniques did you borrow or adapt? What was different about your situation or access? If you were to extend this research, what would you do differently based on what these scholars modeled?

## Weeks 7-8: Autoethnography & Critical Fabulation

### Overview
Turn the lens on yourself. Examine your own media consumption, creative practice, or cultural participation. How does your experience illuminate broader patterns? Try critical fabulation—imagining alternative narratives or speculative scenarios based on gaps in existing research. Get comfortable with creative-critical hybrid approaches.

### Readings

- Saidiya Hartman, "Venus in Two Acts" - critical fabulation methodology
- Wendy Chun, selections from *Programmed Visions* - on digital memory and erasure
- Shannon Mattern, "Cloud and Field" - on archives and infrastructure
- **Return to *Preserving Worlds*:** What archival choices are being made?

### Writing Prompts

#### Option A: Critical Fabulation (3-4 pages)

Following Saidiya Hartman's method, write about a disappeared or barely-documented digital space, community, or moment. This could be:

- An early online community that left few traces
- A game server that shut down
- Your own lost digital artifacts (emails, MySpace page, forum posts)
- A platform or feature that no longer exists

Use the fragments you can find (screenshots, Wayback Machine captures, others' memories) as evidence, but allow yourself to imagine and speculate. What might have happened in the gaps? Who might have been there whose stories weren't recorded? Write in a way that acknowledges you're imagining while staying grounded in what little evidence exists. Reflect on what this method allows you to say that straight archival work wouldn't.

#### Option B: Autoethnography (3-4 pages)

Write about your own relationship to a digital platform, practice, or community. Make your personal experience the subject of analysis. How does your specific experience illuminate broader patterns about digital culture, media consumption, identity, or community? 

Use "I" freely, but also step back: What cultural forces shaped your experience? What assumptions did you bring? How has your relationship to this space/practice changed over time? Connect your story to broader questions about media, memory, identity, or community.

This isn't memoir—it's using your experience as data to understand something larger.

## Weeks 9-10: Digital Methods & Platforms

### Overview
Explore digital research tools suited to your interests—basic social media analysis, digital archives, computational text analysis, or network mapping. The goal isn't technical mastery but understanding what digital methods can and can't tell you. Compare findings with your earlier ethnographic or textual work.

### Readings
- danah boyd and Kate Crawford, "Critical Questions for Big Data"
- Tarleton Gillespie, selections from *Custodians of the Internet* - platform governance
- Richard Rogers, "Digital Methods for Web Research"
- **Explore tools:** Internet Archive Wayback Machine, basic social media scrapers, or timeline visualization tools

### Writing Prompt: Trace & Compare (3-4 pages)

Use digital tools to investigate the history or current state of something. Options:

- Use Wayback Machine to trace how a website evolved over time
- Collect and analyze social media posts around a hashtag, event, or trend (even just manually)
- Map the connections between related communities or platforms
- Trace references to a virtual world, game, or community across the web

Then write about your findings AND your method. What did this approach reveal? What patterns emerged? But also: What didn't you find? What questions can't these methods answer? What would ethnography or close reading show that data collection misses?

Compare your digital findings with one of your earlier exercises (close reading or ethnography). What does each method make visible or invisible?

**Engage with boyd and Crawford's "Critical Questions for Big Data."** What are the limitations and assumptions of the digital methods you used? What context is missing from your data? How might the tools themselves shape what you found? Even if you're working on a small scale, what cautions do they raise that apply to your work?

---

## Weeks 11-12: Project Development

### Overview

Choose one method (or a combination) that best suits your research question. Design a small-scale documentary/podcast project you can actually complete. Develop your research question, methodology, and plan for execution.

### Readings

- Choose 2-3 methodological readings relevant to your chosen approach
- Workshop research questions and methodology

### Writing Prompt: Research Proposal (3-4 pages)

Write a proposal for your final documentary/podcast project. Include:

**1. Research Question/Curiosity:** What are you investigating? Frame this as genuine curiosity, not a predetermined argument. What do you want to understand better?

**2. Methodology:** Which research method(s) will you use? Why are these appropriate for your question? Will you do interviews (ethnography)? Analyze texts or platforms (close reading)? Work with archives or memory? Use your own experience (autoethnography)? Combine approaches?

**3. Media Form:** Why documentary, podcast, video essay, or audio piece? What can this form do that a written essay can't? What aesthetic or structural choices will you make?

**4. Failed Experiments:** What have you tried that didn't work? What dead ends taught you something? This is crucial—research is messy.

**5. Prototype Description:** Describe your 2-3 minute sample. What will it show about your approach?

**6. Timeline & Next Steps:** What do you need to do in the next few weeks?

Be specific but stay flexible. The point is to articulate your thinking so far, not lock yourself into something that might not work.

**Presentation:** Present your proposal in class (5 minutes) along with your brief prototype or proof-of-concept.

---

## Weeks 13-14: Project Execution & Analysis

### Overview

Conduct your research. Collect data, make observations, perform your analysis, and create your documentary/podcast/multimedia piece. Stay flexible—research rarely goes exactly as planned, and adapting your approach is part of the learning.

### Readings

- Readings relevant to your specific project topic
- Regular check-ins on progress and challenges

---

## Week 15: Reflection & Presentation

### Overview

Complete your project and, importantly, reflect on your research process. What did this method reveal? What did it obscure? How did your question evolve? What would you do differently?

### Readings

- Review selections from earlier readings
- Reflect: How did your method shape what you could see and say?

### Final Deliverables

#### Creative Component (10-15 minutes)

An experimental documentary, podcast, audio essay, video essay, or similar multimedia piece that uses one or more research methods explored in the course. This should demonstrate your methodology in practice—whether that's ethnographic observation, critical fabulation, archival investigation, or hybrid approaches.

#### Written Reflection: Methods Reflection Essay (4-5 pages)

This accompanies your creative project. Reflect on:

**1. Evolution:** How did your question, approach, and project change from proposal to completion? What caused those changes?

**2. Method in Practice:** How did your chosen research method shape what you discovered? What did it let you see? What did it obscure or leave out? Would a different method have produced different insights?

**3. Form & Content:** How did the creative/documentary form shape your research? What could you express through audio/video/multimedia that you couldn't in writing? What challenges did the form present?

**4. Failures & Surprises:** What didn't work? What surprised you? What would you do differently if you started over?

**5. Epistemological Reflection:** What does this process teach you about how we know things? About the relationship between method and knowledge? About your own way of thinking and investigating?

Avoid generic reflection ("I learned a lot"). Be specific about methodological insights. Quote from your own field notes, failed drafts, or earlier exercises. Show your thinking process.
